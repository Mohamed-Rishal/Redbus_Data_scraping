# Redbus_Data_scraping
This project is a web scraping application using Selenium and Streamlit to collect bus data from RedBus, including both private and government-operated buses (e.g., TNSTC). The scraped data includes details such as bus routes, names, departure times, ratings, prices, and available seats. The data is then stored in a MySQL database for further use.
